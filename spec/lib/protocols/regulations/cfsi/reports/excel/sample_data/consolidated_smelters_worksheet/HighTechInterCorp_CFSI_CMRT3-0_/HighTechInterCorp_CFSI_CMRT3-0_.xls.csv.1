Introduction,"
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (Template) is a free, standardized reporting template created by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition® (EICC®) and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). The Template facilitates the transfer of information through the supply chain regarding mineral country of origin and smelters and refiners being utilized and supports compliance to legislation*. The template also facilitates the identification of new smelters and refiners to potentially undergo an audit via the Conflict-Free Smelter Program**.","






",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"* In 2010, the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed concerning “conflict minerals” originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or adjoining countries. The SEC published final rules associated with the disclosure of the source of conflict minerals by U.S. publicly traded companies (see the rules at http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34-67716.pdf). The rules reference the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, (http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/GuidanceEdition2.pdf), which guides suppliers to establish policies, due diligence frameworks and management systems.
