,Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative,"Founded in 2008 by members of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative, the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative has grown into one of the most utilized and respected resources for companies addressing conflict minerals issues in their supply chains. Over 150 companies from seven different industries participate in the CFSI today, contributing to a range of tools and resources including the Conflict-Free Smelter Program, the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template, Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry data and a range of guidance documents on conflict minerals sourcing. The CFSI also runs regular workshops on conflict minerals issues and contributes to policy development and debates with leading civil society organizations and governments.

CONFLICT MINERAL.—The term ‘‘conflict mineral’’ means—
(A) columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite, gold, wolframite, or their derivatives; or
(B) any other mineral or its derivatives determined by the Secretary of State to be financing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country.  (available at http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/wallstreetreform-cpa.pdf)",,"

,Independent Private Sector Audit Firm,"With respect to smelter audits, an “Independent Private Sector Audit Firm”, also known as an “Independent third-party audit firm” is a private sector organization competent in evaluating the smelter or refiner’s materials traceability against the standards of the CFSP or equivalent audit protocols.  To maintain neutrality and impartiality, such organization and its audit team members must have no conflicts of interest with the auditee.",,
,Intentionally added,"Intentionally added is commonly known as the deliberate use of a substance, or in this case metal, in the formulation of a product where continued presence is desired to provide a specific characteristic, appearance or quality.

While the SEC does not define the phrase “intentionally added” in the final rule*, the rule’s preamble states:
“[W]e agree that being intentionally added, rather than being a naturally-occurring by-product, is a significant factor in determining whether a conflict mineral is ‘‘necessary to the functionality or production’’ of a product. This is true regardless of who intentionally added the conflict mineral to the product so long as it is contained in the product. [D]etermining whether a conflict mineral is considered ‘‘necessary’’ to a product should not depend on whether the conflict mineral is added directly to the product by the issuer or whether it is added to a component of the product that the issuer receives from a third party. Instead, the issuer should ‘report on the totality of the product and work with suppliers to comply with the requirements.’ Therefore, in determining whether a conflict mineral is ‘‘necessary’’ to a product, an issuer must consider any conflict mineral contained in its product, even if that conflict mineral is only in the product because it was included as part of a component of the product that was manufactured originally by a third party.”

,Necessary for the Functionality of a Product,"The SEC does not provide a formal definition of this phrase in the final rule*, however it provides some guidance: A conflict mineral will be considered to be necessary to its functionality of a product if it meets the following: 1) is intentionally added to the product or any component of the product and is not a naturally-occurring byproduct; 2) is necessary to the product’s generally expected function, use or purpose; and 3) is incorporated for the purpose of ornamentation, decoration, or embellishment, whether the primary purpose of the product is ornamentation or decoration.

NOTE: The conflict mineral must be contained in the product to be applicable.

,Necessary for the Production of a Product,"The SEC does not provide a formal definition of this phrase in the final rule*; however, it provides some guidance: A conflict mineral will be considered to be necessary to the production of a product when: 1) it is intentionally included in the product’s production process, other than if it is included in a tool, machine, or equipment used to produce the product (such as computers or power lines); 2) it is included in the product (MUST be contained in the product to be applicable); and 3) it is necessary to the product.
