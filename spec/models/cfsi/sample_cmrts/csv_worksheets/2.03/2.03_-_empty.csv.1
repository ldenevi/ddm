Introduction,"
"
"This EICC-GeSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (the Template) was created by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition® (EICC®) and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) as a common means for the collection of sourcing information related to “Conflict Minerals”.  Companies in the electronics and all other industries may adopt this Template as an element of their due diligence program to verify the responsible sourcing of materials and to support compliance to new legislation*. This Template is consistent with EICC and GeSI’s related activities including the Conflict Free Smelter (CFS) Program**.","






"
"* In 2010, the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act was passed concerning “Conflict Minerals” originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or adjoining countries. The SEC has published final rules associated with the disclosure of the source of Conflict Minerals by U.S. publicly traded companies (see the rules at http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34-67716.pdf). The rules reference the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, (http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/62/30/46740847.pdf), which guides suppliers to establish policies, due diligence frameworks, and management systems.
