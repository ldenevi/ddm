,"A change in the first digit of the revision number (e.g., 1.0 to 2.0) signifies a set of major improvements have occurred which will likely include different data reporting requirements. Changes to the first or second decimal place (e.g., “2.01” to “2.02”) indicate only minor changes have been made to the template which are not expected to result in substantial changes to the data being reported.  The addition of a letter (e.g., “a”, or “b”, or “c”) following the revision number indicate that only the standard smelter list has been updated from the prior version.",,,,,
